						<p>Visiting his parents for Christmas, Andy, the narrator of Douglas Coupland's literally generation-defining novel <cite>Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture (1991)</cite>, comes to a realisation:</p>
						<blockquote>when you're middle class, you have to live with the fact that history will ignore you. You have to live with the fact that history can never champion your causes and that history will never feel sorry for you. It is the price that is paid for day-to-day comfort and silence.<sup class='citation'>1</sup></blockquote>
						<p>This leads Andy to flee, back to ‘slumming’ with cynical friends, a listless lifestyle that came to define a generation in popular imagination.</p>
						<p>I recently dropped in on ‘<a href='https://douglascouplandconference.wordpress.com/'><cite class='other'>Douglas Coupland and the Art of the “Extreme Present”</cite>’</a>, a conference celebrating the twentieth anniversary of <cite>Generation X</cite>, to get a sense of current work on generational discourse in literary academia. However, the enthusiasm that the speakers and audience had for Coupland’s work persuaded me to revisit <cite>Generation X</cite> and try his less-discussed <cite>Generation A</cite> (2009). Reading the former, I was struck by its ambiguous treatment of the middle-class anxieties that shape its generational claims. Like the recent wave of <a href='https://index.medium.com/why-the-hybrid-workforce-of-the-future-depends-on-the-geriatric-millennial-6f9ff4de1d23'>lazy think pieces about ‘geriatric millennials’</a>, it weaves demographic analyses into overreaching generalisations. However, its unique form—something between a <cite>Decameron</cite> and a guidebook—presents this as an ongoing process of storytelling in the minds of those who identify, and identify with, generational identities. In particular, it suggests that these activities of storytelling and identification are born in the minds of young, specifically middle-class, Americans</p> 
						<p>In his paper presented at the Coupland conference, Nick Hubble referenced an article by Sherry Ortner on the limitations of generational analysis. Ortner describes <cite>Generation X</cite> as ‘an attempt to deal with profound changes in the US middle class in the late 20th century’ and notes that the novel is ‘first and foremost, about identity through work’.<sup class='citation'>2</sup> Hubble himself observes that the novel struggles with generational identity as a limited concept for narrating ‘accelerated culture’ where overarching historical narratives—what Coupland calls ‘genuine capital <em>H</em> history times’—have dissolved. Ultimately, however, he holds to the idea of a ‘real-life Generation X’ as a ‘lived generational space whose boundaries, experiences and possibilities were shaped by the previous generation’.<sup class='citation'>3</sup>  Here I differ. In my view, there is no ‘real' Generation X that Coupland’s novel represents. Instead, <cite>Generation X</cite> dismantles and exposes the conditions of this identity by performing its construction.</p>
						<p>Andy begins to think about what he calls his ‘X-generation’ by applying generational discourse from Japanese culture to his workplace. His X-generation is not a universal or even a national generation—instead, it’s a group of young office workers who withdraw from stable office work in favour of travelling funded by short-term ‘McJobs’.<sup class='citation'>4</sup> As Dag puts it, they choose to live in basements because, ‘the air above is too middle class’.<sup class='citation'>5</sup> The X-generation seems to flee from comfort, rather than finding themselves barred from it. </p>
						<p>Elsewhere, however, the novel suggests that this ‘choice’ is a coping strategy for those undergoing the squeezing of the American middle class. Concepts in the footnotes like ‘Safety Net-ism’ and ‘Homeowner Envy’ present economic security and home ownership as fantasies for the X-generation. Yet the characters’ complaints usually concern <em>inheritance</em>. The protagonists all have wealthy parents. Early on, Dag vandalizes a car because its bumper sticker declares ‘WE’RE SPENDING OUR CHILDREN’S INHERITANCE’ and he wants to ‘punish some aging crock for frittering away my world’.<sup class='citation'>6</sup> Later in the novel, he criticises his parents for ‘blithely handing over the world to us like so much skid-marked underwear’.<sup class='citation'>7</sup> Here, Dag abstracts the question of intergenerational wealth from his family to society on a global scale.</p>
						<p>In this respect, <cite>Generation X</cite> represents the degree to which generational discourse suppresses the class dimensions of its primary concern. The case for the supposed ‘futurelessness’ of the X-generation is stated but not made. Rather than inheriting an estate, the middle-class protagonists write a capital H history in which they inherit the world itself, which their selfish parents have mishandled. This abstracts inheritance, suppressing its class determination. If the complaint is that the older generation is spending all their capital, instead of passing it on as expected, then where does it go once spent? And to whom is it then bequeathed? Which members of a generation are set to inherit wealth, which aren’t, and why? These seem like more worthwhile avenues of discussion than comparing the wealth of broadly defined cohorts.</p>
